It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and
diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis.
Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern
or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by
random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case
of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system.
The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six
essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves
appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns
on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered.
Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two
dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling.
